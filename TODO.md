TODO
====

In roughly decreasing order of priority:

- Implement a label system
- Use binary search for determining which instruction to execute
- Implement arbitrary precision numbers
- Alert for access violations/buffer overflows
- Alert for syntactical errors
- Allow arbitrary files to be passed on the command line
- Eliminate dependency on Irvine32.inc
- Eliminate restrictions on size of code (w/buffered interpretation)
